# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. The dataset used in this project is derived from the Titanic dataset, which is a well-known dataset used in machine learning.

## Project Structure

- **task1_codsoft.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **tested.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **titanic_survival_model.pkl**: The trained machine learning model saved for future use (optional).
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including:
- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Pclass**: The passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: The name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: The gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: The ticket number.
- **Fare**: The fare paid by the passenger.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number (if applicable).
- **Embarked**: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- **Survived**: The target variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Model

The model used in this project is a **Random Forest Classifier**. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification tasks.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handling missing values.
    - Encoding categorical variables.
    - Feature selection.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Training the Random Forest model on the training set.
    - Predicting outcomes on the test set.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Accuracy score.
    - Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score).
    - Confusion matrix.
    - Feature importance analysis.

4. **Model Saving** (Optional):
    - Saving the trained model as a `.pkl` file for future use.

## How to Run

1. **Requirements**:
    - Python 3.x
    - Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE
    - Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `joblib`

2. **Steps to Execute**:
    - Clone the repository or download the files.
    - Open the `task1_codsoft.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
    - Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
    - (Optional) Save the trained model using the provided code.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. The feature importance plot provides insight into which features are most predictive of survival on the Titanic.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to building a machine learning model for predicting Titanic survival. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.
